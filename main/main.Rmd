This R code represents the conversion of the MATLAB code of the GHK estimation of the homogenous sequential search model used in Ursu Seiler Honka 2024.

The below file is the R equivalent of the main.m code:

```{r STEP 1}
# Due to R lacking the mfilename facility MATLAB has, or an equivalent way to represent the current filename, we re-engineer the code such that the estimation script is called as a function, with D and seed set in the main.R script and passed as args. We make use of a for loop to run for each seed value, analogous to running <seed> different estimation scripts.

source("estWeitz_ghk_D100.R")

for (i in 1:50) {
  estimate(D=100, seed=i)
}
```

```{r STEP 2}
# "run code "average.m" to average the results obtained from the estimation above"

source("average.R")
```
